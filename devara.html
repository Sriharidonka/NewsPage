            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                In April 2021, it was reported that Rama Rao and Siva would collaborate for NTR30, marking their second collaboration after Janatha Garage (2016).[5] The film was announcement on Ugadi (13 April 2021) with Yuvasudha Arts producing the film in collaboration with N. T. R. Arts.[6] However, Siva's commitments on Acharya and Rama Rao's on RRR had delayed the start of production.

                <br>
                Siva described it as a "large-scale project that has more commercial appeal" in comparison to his debut film Mirchi (2013).[8] Following the box-office failure of Acharya, Siva wanted to fine-tune the script making necessary changes before finalizing it as a draft, which meant that the commencement of filming has been delayed throughout late 2022.[9][10] By November, Siva started the pre-production works of the film with production set to begin in early 2023.

                <br>
                Initially set to begin production on 24 February 2023, the commencement was delayed due to the demise of Taraka Ratna as well as Rama Rao's participation in the Academy Awards campaign for RRR.[12] The film was officially launched on 23 March 2023 with a puja ceremony held in Hyderabad with the presence of the cast and crew and S. S. Rajamouli preceding with the muhurat shot.[13] The film's title Devara was officially announced on 19 May 2023.[14] On 4 October, Siva announced that the film would be split into two parts.
