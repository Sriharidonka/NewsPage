                Kalki 2898 AD is an upcoming 2024 Indian epic science fiction action film written and directed by Nag Ashwin. Produced by C.
                Aswani Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies, it was shot primarily in Telugu with some scenes reshot in Hindi.[3][4] Inspired by Hindu
                scriptures, the film is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in the year 2898 AD. It stars Prabhas in the titular role alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Deepika Padukone and Disha Patani.
                <br><br>
                First announced in February 2020, Kalki's production faced a year's delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming finally began in July 2021
                at a futuristic set at Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, and continued sporadically in several legs over the next three years before wrapping 
                in March 2024. Made on a ₹600 crore (US$75 million) production budget, Kalki is the most expensive Indian film ever. Its music is scored by
                Santhosh Narayanan, with cinematography by Djordje Stojiljkovic, production design by Nitin Zihani Choudhary and editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao.
                <br><br>
                Kalki 2898 AD was initially scheduled to release on 9 May 2024, but was postponed due to the ongoing 2024 Indian General Election. It is now scheduled to release worldwide on 27 June 2024 in theatres.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
            After the success of Mahanati in 2019, Nag Ashwin stated that he had been working on an original story and screenplay for a long time 
            which would begin production soon.[11] That August, Vyjayanthi Movies announced that the production would begin in September and posted 
            a casting call for visual artists, designers and writers.[12][13] Prabhas was revealed by the production house on 26 February 2020, coinciding
            50th year since the establishment of their studio, to be the lead actor of the film.[14][15] Tentatively titled #PrabhasNagAshwin and #Prabhas21,
            Ashwin stated that the initial plans were begin filming by late 2020, and release the film by late 2021 in multiple languages;[16] however, the following
            May, producer C. Aswani Dutt stated that filming would begin in October that year and it would release in 2022

        <h3>Filming</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, the film was planned to begin its regular shoot in November 2020. However, it was postponed to the following year due to the advent of the COVID-19
            pandemic.[38] Principal photography commenced in Hyderabad in July 2021 on the occasion of Guru Purnima, following a muhurtam shot featuring Bachchan.[39] Prabhas
             and Padukone joined the production in December 2021 and scenes featuring Bachchan, Prabhas and Padukone were shot.[40][41] The second schedule of the shoot took 
             place in February 2022.[42]<br><br>
            Instead of shooting the entire film in a single stretch, the team divided its 80–90 days of shoot into 7–8 days every month. This allowed the production team to take
             time and prepare the gadgets and props to be used in the film. Therefore, the production of the film was expected to take longer than usual.[43] DIY Arri Alexa 65 camera
             was used to shoot the film, thus making it the first Indian film to use this technology.[44]<br><br>
            Prabhas was expected to start filming his solo portions in April 2022,[45] however, his knee surgery led to a delay of his upcoming projects including Salaar and Kalki 2898 AD.[46] 90%
            of the shoot was done in sets built in Ramoji Film City.[47] In June, Bachchan shot for a scene at Raidurg metro station.[48] In July, Padukone and Prabhas shot for a car chase
             sequence in Hyderabad.[49] Prabhas completed shooting the majority of his portions by the end of this schedule.[50]<br><br>
            Principal photography of the film was expected to be completed by January 2023, following which post-production and visual effects works would take around 8 months.[51] However, 
            the film was still being shot in March 2023 when Bachchan injured his ribs and was advised to take rest in Mumbai.[52] Around 70% of the filming was completed by June 2023.[53] 
            A romantic track featuring Prabhas and Disha Patani was filmed in Italy in March 2024.

        <h3>Post Production</h3>
        <p>
            The film was recognised as "Project K" which served as the working title of the film.[29] Ashwin stated that the film needed high-end technology and futuristic vehicles to be developed
             for the film. While they can be recreated using computer-generated imagery (CGI), Ashwin wanted them to feel "authentic and genuine", therefore opted to build these vehicles from scratch 
            with a dedicated team of engineers.[30] In March 2022, Ashwin requested businessman Anand Mahindra to provide technical support to build such type of vehicles.[31]<br<<br>
            A few days later, Mahindra responded that their company Mahindra & Mahindra would assist the production team from their Mahindra Research Valley campus in Chennai.[32] In July 2021, the 
            makers have erected a futuristic set at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad where a significant portion of filming is expected to take place.[33]<br><br>
            In August 2020, A. R. Rahman was initially approached to compose music for the film. Rahman did not sign the film,[34] and Ashwin retained technicians from his earlier film Mahanati (2018),
             namely, composer Mickey J. Meyer and cinematographer Dani Sanchez-Lopez.[35] But later, Serbian cinematographer, Djordje Stojiljkovic, replaced Dani Sanchez-Lopez as the official cinematographer
            of the film. In February 2023, Dutt stated in an interview that Santhosh Narayanan replaced Meyer as the composer, along with a female Bollywood composer composing a song for the film.[36] 
            Singeetam Srinivasa Rao joined the project to serve as a mentor.[37]<br><br>
            Kalki 2898 AD was estimated to be mounted at a budget of ₹600 crore (US$75 million), making it the most expensive Indian film ever made.
