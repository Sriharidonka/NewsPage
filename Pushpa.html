                Pushpa 2: The Rule is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language action drama film directed 
                and written by Sukumar under his Sukumar Writings banner and produced by Naveen Yerneni and Yalamanchili 
                Ravi Shankar under their Mythri Movie Makers banner. The film stars Allu Arjun in the titular role, alongside 
                with an ensemble cast of Fahadh Faasil, Rashmika Mandanna, Dhananjaya, Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari, Rao Ramesh, 
                Ajay, Sunil, Anasuya Bharadwaj, Shanmukh and Ajay Ghosh who are all reprising their roles from the previous film.

                10% of the film's footage was initially shot back-to-back with the original film. However, Sukumar decided to alter the
                 story, which led to the film's principal photography commencing in October 2022. Made on a budget of â‚¹500 crore,[2] the film is
                 one of the most expensive Indian films to date. It is scheduled to release on 15 August 2024,[3] coinciding with India's Independence Day.

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
            Before the release of Pushpa: The Rise in 2021, the film was announced to release in two parts,
            with the filmmakers stating that the maiden part would release that year, whereas the latter part would 
            release the year after (2022).[4] Initially, 10% of the sequel's footage was shot back-to-back with the first part,
            however, Sukumar decided to alter the sequel's story to reportedly fulfill the audience's anticipation and correct
            the previous film's mistakes.[5] The scripting part of the film was completed by July 2022 in Hyderabad.[6][7] The
            official title, Pushpa 2: The Rule, was announced on 22 August 2022. An inaugural muhurat puja ceremony was held on
            the same day in Hyderabad with the presence of the film's cast and crew.[8]

            <br>
            Sukumar wrote the film's script while Srikanth Vissa contributed in the dialogues.[9] Sukumar further retained most
            of the technicians from previous part including cinematographer Miroslaw Kuba Brozek, editor Karthika Srinivas and Ruben,
            art director S. Ramakrishna and Monica Nigotre and sound designer Resul Pookutty and Vijay Kumar.[10][11] Deepali Noor and
            Sheetal Sharma served as costume designers while Preeti Sheel Singh was hired as character designer. Peter Hein, Kecha Kamphakdee,
            Dragon Prakash and Nabakanta were hired as stunt directors. Dance choreographers of the film includes Prem Rakshith, Ganesh Acharya,
            Vijay Polaki and Shrashti Verma.[12] Later, editor Ruben opted out of the film and was replaced by Naveen Nooli.[13]
